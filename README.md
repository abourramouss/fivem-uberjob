# fivem-uberjob
The idea behind this script is to add a “mini-job” to the game, to add more dynamism to your server.
The job can be accessed via the “/uberJob” command.

Requirements:
ESX_Job 30
ESX_Jobslisting 19
t0sic_loadingbar 37

# How it works:

Just use the command “/uberJob” to get a new delivery
New locations can be added easily by modifying the config.lua file.
Payments or distances can be also modified.

# How to install:
Just start the dependencies first. It’s very important to start the t0sic loading bar first.
Then, install the .sql file.
When everything is done, you can install the script.
Also from the .SQL file you should change the name to your name’s database in "USE tablename"
